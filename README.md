# Description

This is a web application designed to provide its users all the information required  to make cocktails in the comfort of their own homes. The flow of the application is as such : First the Users would be taken to a login page where they would have the option to sign up using a simple email and password. Once the user has signed up they can sign in using their credentials and would be taken to a preference page. The user would be signed up using Firebase Authentication.

Landing on the preference page would open up a modal which confirms your age to grant access to the preference page.  On the preference page the user can select various ingredients from three main categories : Alcohol, Fruits and Non-alcoholic. After selecting their preferences the user would press the submit button which would take in the users information and store it in a mysql database which would be later used for populating a number of drinks based on their preferences on the main page. On the main page there is a carousel of cards used from Materialize Css which shows different cocktails and reveals their ingredients when clicked. It also features a "shocktail" me button that brings up a random cocktail and its ingredients.
